# Overview
Research outcomes: **SHG Optimization**, **SHG Duty Cycle Modulation**, **THG**, **Numerical Solver**

# SHG Optimization
**Conventional**: Connection of constant periods, insert phase shift domains in between, adjust width $\to$ broadband.  
**This Work**: Mathematical optimization $\to$ further broadband.

# SHG Duty Cycle Modulation
**Conventional**: Phase shift problem exists in Duty Cycle Modulation in SHG and SPDC.  
**This Work**: Theory correction completely solves phase problem $\therefore$ (Analytically inverse design Gaussian spectrum in one shot $\therefore$ Pure state single photon generation) & (Various spectral shapes possible in SHG $\therefore$ Usage unknown).

# THG
**Conventional**: Tandem structure of SHG period + SFG period.  
**This Work**: cTHG and mathematical optimization $\to$ (Higher efficiency) & (Same efficiency with longer period $\therefore$ Easy fabrication).

# Numerical Solver
For CWEs (SHG & cTHG)

**Conventional**: Tracking fine phase rotation by RK method $\therefore$ Slow & poor accuracy.  
**This Work**: Picard iteration 1st approximation $\to$ 100x faster.
