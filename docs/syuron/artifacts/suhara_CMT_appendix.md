NLO interactions in waveguides are interpreted in terms of distributed coupling between waveguide modes. In many cases, waves of different frequencies are involved. Although it is not explicitly denoted, (2.58) represents a set of differential equations for each frequency. In the following, superscripts will be used to specify the frequency. In addition, (2.58) is valid for each mode $m$. The right hand side of (2.58) includes nonlinear terms of mode amplitudes and may include mode amplitudes at other frequencies, since the polarization is a nonlinear function of the total electric field. Thus (2.58) interprets nonlinear interactions including those across frequencies. If only one mode for each frequency is involved in the coupling, the mode subscript $m$ and $\Sigma$ in (2.57) can be omitted.

To illustrate the specific form of the coupled-mode equations, let us consider guided-mode second-harmonic generation (SHG) as an example. A detailed analysis will be given in the next chapter. Substituting (2.57a) into (2.43) and substituting the results into (2.58) yield

$$\frac{d}{dz} A^\omega(z) = -j \kappa^* [A^\omega(z)]^* A^{2\omega}(z) \exp \{-j(2\Delta)z \}, \quad (2.59a)$$

$$\frac{d}{dz} A^{2\omega}(z) = -j \kappa [A^\omega(z)]^2 \exp \{+j(2\Delta)z \}, \quad (2.59b)$$

$$2\Delta = \beta^{2\omega} - 2\beta^\omega \quad (2.60)$$

$$\kappa = \frac{2\omega\epsilon}{4} \iint [E^{2\omega}(x,y)]^* \mathbf{d}(x,y) [E^\omega(x,y)]^2 dxdy . \quad (2.61)$$
